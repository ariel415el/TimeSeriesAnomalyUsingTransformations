5/6/2019:   - Started Git project.
			- Reproduced Paper's result on Mnist with 1 as normal digit

9/6/2019:   - Created a generic series trainer based on classification datasets.
12/6/2019:  - generic series does not converge yet. Tryin an alternative with continous functions.

15/6/2019   - continous functions : taining with linear fuctions as normal seem to converge. 
				* Model can diffrentiate between linear functions and noise ( Not really, seem to overfeat)
				* Model Seeem to overfeat sinusoids
				* Trying Elhanan suggestion for quantizing the serie and generating all permutations over segments
				* 22/6 still overfeats

29/6/2019: - Still with continous functions.
				 * Training on increasing linear (no bias) functions with 100 random permutations converged.
				 * Model is able to differentiate from sinus, normal noise and  decreasing functions
