5/6/2019:   - Started Git project.
			- Reproduced Paper's result on Mnist with 1 as normal digit

9/6/2019:   - Created a generic series trainer based on classification datasets.
12/6/2019:  - generic series does not converge yet. Tryin an alternative with continous functions.

15/6/2019   - continous functions : taining with linear fuctions as normal seem to converge. 
				* Model can diffrentiate between linear functions and noise ( Not really, seem to overfeat)
				* Model Seeem to overfeat sinusoids
				* Trying Elhanan suggestion for quantizing the serie and generating all permutations over segments
				* 22/6 still overfeats

29/6/2019: - Still with continous functions.
				 * Training on increasing linear (no bias) functions with 100 random permutations converged.
				 * Model is able to differentiate from sinus, normal noise and  decreasing functions
				 * Same results with 412 permutations
				 * Two major bugs were detected
				 	1: The fuction generator returned the same function in different next() calls
				 	2: I had dropout after the convolution layer created major and wierd gap between train and val (lower val)
				 * Model learned

5/7/2019   - Model  was able to learn linear sinusoid and differentioate between it and noise.
		   - Now trying to add local anomalies: the model is able yo detect when noise is added to 30% of a random segments.
		   - trying higher order sinusoids as last POC:
		   		only after browdening the FC latent layer the model was able to train. Again able to detect noise added to 30% of random segment

11/7/2019  - Built a new phisics engine and workflow to detect anomaly in simple synthetic videos of bouncing rectangles
12/7/2019  - Imported an architecture of 3Dcnn that is used to classifiy videos. model does not converge yet 
16/7/2019  - Side experiment to check the 3dcnn architectue in understanding videos:
			 Differentiate single bouncing ball videos with changing size from such with constant size
		   			* Training succedded on 10000/1000 train/val videos

16/7/2019  - Training the 3dcnn to learn permutaions over video frames of one object with specific figure, at test we compare reordering percentages
		   	  with other figures:
		   	  	* Model learned permutation on a square but failed to differentite in test from other 4 figures
		   	  	  This may be due to the fact that the details of the figures does not matter since one can regard them all as blobs and track them
		   	  	  Maybe a more suitable poc scenario is one where the network has to focus on the object details to suceed.
		   	  	  IDead: videos where the object chages shapes in a specific order.


16/7/201    - I tried to differentiate betweeen two balls moving freely and two balls with an invisible wall between them. The model learned the permutations 
		   	 but I'm not sure if it can differentioate ~99% vs ~90% accuracy
